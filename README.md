## Project Overview

### Introduction

**CookBook** is a social media platform designed for food enthusiasts to **Create, Explore, and Share Recipes** from around the world. Inspired by popular platforms like Facebook and Instagram, CookBook focuses on cooking and recipes while maintaining familiar social media features. It creates a unique digital space where users can connect through their love of food, share their culinary creations, and explore new recipes from others.

The platform is designed to be accessible to users of all skill levels, fostering an open, collaborative environment for discovering new ideas, sharing cooking techniques, and celebrating favorite dishes.

### Key Features

CookBook includes several main sections to engage users:

- **Home Page**  
  Displays posts from friends and followed users along with notifications for new comments, likes, and shares. This is the hub for staying updated with content from the user’s network.

- **Discover Recipes**  
  A feed showcasing trending and recommended recipes tailored to user interests and popular dishes, inspired by Instagram's Discover page. It serves as a source of inspiration for new culinary adventures.

- **My CookBook**  
  Acts as both a profile page and a personal recipe collection. Users can view and manage their posts, saved recipes, and profile details (like bio, follower count, etc.).

- **Groups**  
  Allows users to join communities based on specific cuisines, diets, or cooking techniques. Users can share content, ask questions, and connect with others who share their culinary interests.

### User Experience

CookBook’s layout is intuitive, featuring four main sections: **Home**, **Discover Recipes**, **My CookBook**, and **Groups**. These sections offer an immersive yet easy-to-navigate experience. The platform fosters a welcoming space where food lovers can express their passion for cooking and expand their culinary knowledge.

### 2.4 Facilitate Community Building through Groups

CookBook’s **Groups** section allows users to connect over specific culinary interests, diets, or techniques. This feature encourages community-driven interaction and transforms CookBook into a platform that fosters shared learning and engagement.

### 2.5 Maintain a Safe, Engaging Platform for All Users

CookBook is committed to maintaining a respectful and positive environment. Users are encouraged to engage kindly, and moderation ensures the platform remains welcoming. Privacy settings and notifications give users control over interactions and content visibility.
